**DEC-01: Empowering Citizen-Centric Data Sharing - Step 2: Specification**

**Date:** May 8, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

**1. Problem Statement**

Citizens currently lack meaningful control and sovereignty over their personal data, which is often fragmented across various silos managed by different organizations. This leads to eroded trust, limited transparency in data usage, missed opportunities for value creation through ethical data sharing, and an increased risk of data misuse. The core challenge is to shift the paradigm towards a citizen-centric model where individuals are empowered to manage, share, and benefit from their personal data securely and with informed consent, thereby fostering a more trustworthy and innovative digital ecosystem.

**2. Detailed Solution Requirements**

The solution must be Robust, Optimized, and Open/Otherwise-compliant (ROO).

**2.1. Technical Requirements**

*   **TR1: Secure and Decentralized Identity Management:**
    *   The system must support W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to allow citizens to create and manage their own digital identities independent of centralized authorities.
    *   It must provide mechanisms for DID resolution and management.
    *   Support for multiple DID methods should be considered for flexibility.
*   **TR2: Granular and Dynamic Consent Mechanisms:**
    *   Citizens must have fine-grained control over what data is shared, with whom, for what purpose, and for how long.
    *   Consent must be explicit, informed, easily understandable, and revocable at any time by the citizen.
    *   The system must maintain a verifiable and auditable record of all consent grants, modifications, and revocations.
    *   Consent receipts (e.g., based on Kantara Initiative's Consent Receipt Specification) should be provided to both citizen and data user.
*   **TR3: Personal Data Stores (PDS) / Digital Wallets:**
    *   Citizens must have access to secure PDS or digital wallets to store their personal data and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
    *   Data within the PDS/wallet must be encrypted, with the citizen holding the keys (client-side encryption).
    *   The PDS/wallet should facilitate the presentation of data and VCs to relying parties based on citizen consent.
*   **TR4: Interoperability Standards Adherence:**
    *   The solution must adhere to open, internationally recognized standards for identity (W3C DIDs), credentials (W3C VC Data Model), and data exchange (e.g., JSON-LD, FHIR for health data where applicable).
    *   APIs must be well-documented (e.g., OpenAPI Specification) to ensure interoperability between different components and participating systems.
*   **TR5: Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) Integration:**
    *   The system should incorporate PETs to minimize data exposure and enhance privacy. Examples include:
        *   Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for selective disclosure of information without revealing underlying data.
        *   Differential privacy for aggregated data analysis.
        *   Homomorphic encryption for computations on encrypted data (where feasible).
*   **TR6: Immutable and Verifiable Audit Logs:**
    *   All data access requests, consent changes, data sharing transactions, and system administrative actions must be logged in a tamper-proof and verifiable audit trail.
    *   Citizens should have access to their relevant audit logs to monitor how their data is being used.
    *   Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) could be considered for the audit log's immutability.
*   **TR7: Secure and Standardized APIs:**
    *   The platform must expose secure APIs for data requesters to interact with the system, subject to citizen consent and authentication.
    *   APIs should follow RESTful principles or GraphQL, secured with protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
*   **TR8: Intuitive and Accessible User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX):**
    *   The citizen-facing interfaces (e.g., PDS/wallet dashboard) must be highly intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical literacy and abilities (WCAG compliance).
    *   Clear explanations of data sharing implications and consent options must be provided.

**2.2. Operational Requirements**

*   **OR1: Clear Governance Framework:**
    *   Establish a comprehensive governance framework defining roles, responsibilities, policies, and dispute resolution mechanisms for all stakeholders (citizens, data providers, data consumers, platform operators).
    *   The framework must ensure accountability and transparency.
*   **OR2: Data Stewardship Models and Ethical Guidelines:**
    *   Define clear data stewardship models and ethical guidelines for all parties handling citizen data, emphasizing data minimization, purpose limitation, and accountability.
*   **OR3: Comprehensive Citizen Support, Education, and Onboarding:**
    *   Provide accessible support channels (e.g., helpdesks, FAQs, tutorials) for citizens.
    *   Develop educational materials to help citizens understand their rights, the platform's functionalities, and the implications of data sharing.
    *   Streamlined and secure onboarding processes for citizens.
*   **OR4: Robust Compliance, Monitoring, and Auditing Processes:**
    *   Implement continuous compliance monitoring against relevant legal, regulatory, and security standards.
    *   Conduct regular internal and third-party audits of the platform and its operations.
*   **OR5: Public Awareness, Trust-Building, and Engagement Strategy:**
    *   Develop and execute a strategy to build public awareness, trust, and encourage adoption of the citizen-centric data sharing model.
    *   Engage with civil society and advocacy groups.
*   **OR6: Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation Enforcement:**
    *   The system and its governance must enforce data minimization (collecting only necessary data) and purpose limitation (using data only for consented purposes).
*   **OR7: Incident Response and Management Plan:**
    *   Develop and maintain a robust incident response plan to address security breaches, data misuse, or system failures promptly and effectively.
    *   Clear communication protocols for affected parties in case of an incident.
*   **OR8: Legal and Regulatory Adherence:**
    *   Ensure the solution complies with all applicable national and international data protection and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, local equivalents).
