**DEC-01: Empowering Citizen-Centric Data Sharing - Architecture**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 8, 2025

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the system architecture for the "Empowering Citizen-Centric Data Sharing" (DEC-01) initiative. The goal is to design a Robust, Optimized, and Open/Otherwise-compliant (ROO) modular system that empowers citizens with control over their personal data. This architecture builds upon the detailed requirements specified in [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md) and the operational flows described in [`DEC-01_Pseudocode_v1.md`](DEC-01_Pseudocode_v1.md:0). It focuses on establishing a trustworthy and innovative digital ecosystem where individuals can manage, share, and benefit from their personal data securely and with informed consent.

**2. High-Level Architecture Overview**

The proposed architecture is founded on the following core principles:

*   **Citizen-Centricity:** The citizen is at the heart of the system, with full control over their identity, data, and how it is shared.
*   **Decentralization:** Leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) minimizes reliance on centralized authorities for identity and attestations, enhancing user autonomy and reducing single points of failure.
*   **Modularity:** Components are designed as distinct, interoperable services. This allows for independent development, deployment, updates, and scaling, fostering flexibility and maintainability.
*   **Security by Design:** Security is an integral part of the architecture, with measures implemented at every layer and for all component interactions, adhering to the principle of least privilege and defense-in-depth.
*   **Interoperability:** Strict adherence to open, internationally recognized standards (W3C DIDs, VCs, OpenAPI, etc.) ensures seamless interaction between diverse components and participating systems.
*   **Privacy by Design & Default:** Privacy-enhancing techniques and data minimization principles are embedded into the system's design and operation from the outset.

**Textual Representation of Architecture:**

The system can be visualized as operating across three primary domains: the Citizen Domain, the Service Provider Domain, and a Shared Infrastructure Domain that facilitates trusted interactions.

**3. Core Components and Responsibilities**

*   **Citizen UI/Wallet (incorporating PDS functionality):**
    *   **Purpose:** The citizen's primary control center for managing their digital identity, personal data, Verifiable Credentials, and consents. It acts as the interface to their Personal Data Store (PDS).
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Secure creation, management, and backup/recovery of citizen's DIDs and associated cryptographic keys (private keys stored locally and encrypted).
        *   Secure storage of personal data attributes and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), encrypted with citizen-controlled keys.
        *   Intuitive interface for viewing data sharing requests, granting/modifying/revoking consent with granular controls (data, purpose, duration).
        *   Generation and presentation of Verifiable Presentations (VPs) to data consumers/gateways.
        *   Interaction with the Secure Data Sharing Gateway and other services using secure protocols (HTTPS, potentially DIDComm).
        *   Access to personal audit logs.
    *   **Technologies:** Native mobile applications (iOS, Android using frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or native Swift/Kotlin), Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Utilizes platform-specific secure storage (Keystore/Secure Enclave) and cryptographic libraries (e.g., Veramo, Aries SDK client-side components).

*   **Personal Data Store (PDS) - Logical Concept:**
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the secure, citizen-controlled repository for their personal data and VCs.
    *   **Note:** The PDS is not necessarily a single, centralized database. It's a logical construct. Data can be stored:
        *   Directly on the citizen's device(s) (managed by the Wallet).
        *   In citizen-controlled cloud storage (e.g., encrypted backups).
        *   In decentralized storage solutions like Solid Pods, where the Wallet acts as the primary access and management interface.
    *   All data within the PDS is encrypted, with keys managed by the citizen via their Wallet.

*   **Consent Management Module:**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the entire lifecycle of data sharing consents, ensuring they are explicit, informed, auditable, and easily manageable by the citizen.
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Securely store detailed consent records (CitizenDID, ConsumerDID, granted data, purpose, duration, status, constraints) as per [`TR2`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:20) and [`F2`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:76).
        *   Provide APIs for the Secure Data Sharing Gateway to verify active and valid consent for incoming data requests.
        *   Facilitate the generation of Verifiable Consent Receipts (as VCs) issued to the citizen (and optionally the consumer) upon consent granting, as per [`TR2`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:20)
*   **Consent Management Module (Continued):**
    *   **Key Functions (Continued):**
        *   Handle consent revocation requests from the citizen and update consent status accordingly.
        *   Maintain an auditable history of all consent lifecycle events (grant, modification, revocation, expiry).
        *   Interface with the Audit Service to log all consent-related activities.
    *   **Technologies:** Secure database (e.g., PostgreSQL as recommended in [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:151`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:151), potentially with extensions for handling JSON-LD or graph-based consent structures if complex relationships are common). Exposes RESTful APIs secured with OAuth 2.0/OIDC for internal system communication.

*   **DID Resolver/Registry:**
    *   **Purpose:** Enables the discovery and resolution of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to their corresponding DID Documents, which contain cryptographic public keys, service endpoints, and other metadata necessary for verifying identity and establishing secure communication channels.
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Support resolution of various DID methods (e.g., `did:key`, `did:web`, `did:ion` as per [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:134`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:134)).
        *   Provide a standardized interface for other components (e.g., Secure Data Sharing Gateway, VC Verification Service, Citizen Wallet) to retrieve DID Documents.
        *   For DID methods requiring registration (e.g., `did:ion`), it may interface with the underlying Distributed Ledger Technology or network.
    *   **Technologies:** Can be implemented based on universal resolver concepts, potentially caching DID documents for performance. For specific DID methods like `did:ion`, it would interact with ION nodes. For `did:web`, it resolves via HTTPS GET requests to a well-known path on a domain.

*   **VC Service (Issuance & Verification & Revocation Registry):**
    *   **Purpose:** A composite service responsible for the lifecycle management of Verifiable Credentials, including their issuance by trusted authorities, robust verification, and checking their revocation status.
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   **VC Issuance:**
            *   Allows authorized and trusted issuers to create, sign (using their DID and private keys), and issue VCs to citizens' Wallets.
            *   Ensures VCs conform to the W3C VC Data Model ([`IS2`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:111)) and relevant profiles (e.g., `vc+jwt`, `vc+ldp`).
        *   **VC Verification:**
            *   Provides an endpoint for the Secure Data Sharing Gateway or Data Consumer applications to submit VPs for verification.
            *   Validates the cryptographic integrity of VCs/VPs (signatures).
            *   Resolves issuer DIDs to retrieve public keys for signature verification.
            *   Checks the validity period of VCs.
            *   Checks against the VC Revocation Registry for the status of the presented credentials.
            *   Validates credential schema and any specific business rules or policies.
        *   **VC Revocation Registry:**
            *   Maintains an up-to-date, verifiable list or mechanism to check if a VC has been revoked by its issuer before its expiry (e.g., W3C VC Status List 2021, or other methods like CRLs if appropriate for the VC type).
            *   Provides an interface for issuers to revoke VCs and for verifiers to query revocation status.
    *   **Technologies:** Utilizes cryptographic libraries for signing and verification (e.g., Veramo, Aries). The Revocation Registry could be implemented using various techniques, from simple status lists hosted at a DID-discoverable endpoint to more complex DLT-based solutions for high-assurance revocation.

*   **Secure Data Sharing Gateway (API Gateway):**
    *   **Purpose:** Acts as the primary secure entry point for Data Consumer Applications to request access to citizen data. It enforces consent, security policies, and orchestrates the data sharing flow.
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Authenticates Data Consumer applications (e.g., using OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow or OIDC).
        *   Authorizes data access requests by:
            *   Interacting with the Consent Management Module to verify active, valid, and sufficient citizen consent for the specific request (matching consumer, data types, purpose, duration).
            *   Interacting with the VC Verification Service to validate any VCs presented by the consumer or required for the transaction.
        *   Enforces data minimization and purpose limitation based on the verified consent.
        *   Routes authorized requests to the appropriate PDS interface or orchestrates data retrieval from the Citizen's Wallet/PDS.
        *   May perform data transformations (e.g., anonymization, filtering, aggregation) as dictated by consent constraints or system policy, potentially by invoking a separate Transformation Service.
        *   Manages API traffic, rate limiting, request/response logging (to Audit Service).
        *   Facilitates secure data packaging and encryption for transmission to the Data Consumer.
    *   **Technologies:** API Gateway solutions (e.g., Kong, Tyk, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management as per [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:163`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:163)). Integrates with OAuth 2.0/OIDC providers.

*   **Data Consumer Applications:**
    *   **Purpose:** External services, applications, or organizations that require access to citizen data for legitimate and consented purposes.
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Register with the platform and obtain credentials for API access.
        *   Initiate data requests to the Secure Data Sharing Gateway, specifying the citizen (via their DID), required data types, and purpose.
        *   Present their own identity credentials (e.g., organizational DID, VCs) if required.
        *   Securely receive and process data in accordance with the terms of the citizen's consent.
        *   Respect consent revocation notices and cease data processing accordingly.
    *   **Technologies:** Varied, depending on the consumer. They interact with the system via standardized RESTful APIs.

*   **Audit Service:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive, immutable, and verifiable log of all significant events and transactions within the system, ensuring transparency and accountability as per [`TR6`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:38).
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Securely record events such as: consent grants, modifications, revocations, expiries; data access requests (received, approved, denied); data retrieval and transmission; administrative actions; security-relevant events.
        *   Ensure log entries are timestamped, attributable (to actors like CitizenDID, ConsumerDID, GatewayID), and contain sufficient detail for later analysis.
        *   Protect log integrity using cryptographic techniques (e.g., hashing, digital signatures, chaining) to make them tamper-proof or tamper-evident.
        *   Provide controlled access to relevant portions of the audit log for citizens (their own data activity) and authorized administrators/auditors.
    *   **Technologies:** Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) like Hyperledger Fabric or a private Ethereum instance (as suggested in [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:160`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:160)), write-once databases, or cryptographically chained log files stored securely.

*   **(Optional) Identity Verification Service:**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a mechanism for verifying real-world identities of citizens or organizations, often as a prerequisite for issuing certain high-assurance Verifiable Credentials.
    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   Integrate with authoritative identity proofing services or processes.
        *   Verify identity documents or attributes with citizen consent.
        *   Provide attestations that can be used by VC Issuers.
    *   **Note:** This component is often external or a trusted third-party service, integrated via APIs.

**4. Data Flow and Communication Protocols**

The core data flows are derived from the pseudocode in [`DEC-01_Pseudocode_v1.md`](DEC-01_Pseudocode_v1.md:0) and leverage secure communication protocols.

*   **A. Citizen Consent Granting Flow:**
    1.  **Request Presentation (Citizen UI/Wallet):** A Data Consumer's request (or a proactive offer from a service) is presented to the citizen via their Wallet, detailing consumer identity (resolved via DID Resolver), data requested, purpose, and duration.
    2.  **Citizen Decision (Citizen UI/Wallet):** Citizen reviews and approves, denies, or approves with modifications.
    3.  **Consent Record Creation (Consent Management Module):** If approved, the Wallet signals the Consent Management Module (via HTTPS/REST API) to create a detailed consent record.
    4.  **Storage (Consent Management Module):** The consent record is stored securely.
    5.  **Consent Receipt (VC Service & Citizen UI/Wallet):** The Consent Management Module may request the VC Service to issue a Verifiable Consent Receipt. This VC is then sent to the Citizen's Wallet for storage.
    6.  **Audit (Audit Service):** All steps are logged by the Audit Service.
    *   **Protocols:** HTTPS/RESTful APIs for Wallet-to-Backend communication. JSON/JSON-LD for data payloads. DIDComm could be used for more direct wallet-to-wallet or wallet-to-service consent negotiation if supported.

*   **B. Data Access Request & Consent Verification Flow:**
    1.  **Request Initiation (Data Consumer -> Secure Data Sharing Gateway):** Consumer sends an authenticated (OAuth 2.0) data access request (HTTPS/REST) specifying CitizenDID, requested data, and purpose.
    2.  **Authentication & Initial Validation (Gateway):** Gateway authenticates the consumer.
    3.  **Consent Verification (Gateway -> Consent Management Module):** Gateway queries the Consent Module (HTTPS/REST) with request details.
    4.  **Consent Check (Consent Management Module):** Module retrieves relevant active consents for the CitizenDID & ConsumerDID pair, validates against request parameters (data types, purpose, expiry, constraints).
    5.  **VC Verification (Gateway -> VC Verification Service - if applicable):** If the transaction requires VCs from the consumer or citizen (e.g., for eligibility), the Gateway uses the VC Service to verify them. This involves DID resolution for issuer keys and revocation checks.
    6.  **Decision & Audit (Gateway & Audit Service):** Based on consent and VC verification, Gateway approves or denies. The decision and key details are logged by the Audit Service.
    *   **Protocols:** HTTPS/RESTful APIs, OAuth 2.0/OIDC. JSON/JSON-LD.

*   **C. Secure Data Retrieval Flow (Post-Consent Verification):**
    1.  **Data Retrieval Instruction (Gateway -> Citizen UI/Wallet or PDS Interface):** If access is approved, the Gateway signals the Citizen's Wallet/PDS (via secure, mutually authenticated HTTPS/REST API or potentially DIDComm) to prepare the authorized data.
    2.  **Data Preparation (Citizen UI/Wallet/PDS):** The Wallet/PDS retrieves the specific data attributes authorized by the consent. Client-side encryption keys are used to decrypt data if necessary before any consented transformations.
    3.  **Transformation (Optional - Gateway or PDS):** If consent requires transformations (e.g., anonymization, specific attribute filtering), these are applied.
    4.  **Secure Packaging (Gateway/PDS):** Data is packaged and encrypted using the Data Consumer's public key (obtained from their resolved DID document).
    5.  **Data Transmission (Gateway -> Data Consumer):** Encrypted data package is sent to the Data Consumer over a secure channel (HTTPS/REST).
    6.  **Audit (Audit Service):** Data retrieval and transmission events are logged.
    *   **Protocols:** HTTPS/RESTful APIs. Data payloads encrypted end-to-end for the consumer where possible.

*   **D. Citizen Consent Revocation Flow:**
    1.  **Revocation Request (Citizen UI/Wallet -> Consent Management Module):** Citizen initiates revocation for a specific consent via their Wallet. Request sent via HTTPS/REST.
    2.  **Update Consent Status (Consent Management Module):** Module verifies citizen ownership, updates the consent record status to "revoked," and records revocation timestamp.
    3.  **Notification (Optional - Consent Management Module -> Data Consumer):** The system may attempt to notify the affected Data Consumer of the revocation (e.g., via a webhook or DIDComm message).
    4.  **Audit (Audit Service):** Revocation event is logged.
    *   **Protocols:** HTTPS/RESTful APIs.

**Primary Communication Protocols Summary:**

*   **HTTPS/RESTful APIs:** The backbone for most client-server and server-server interactions, secured with TLS 1.3+. APIs will be defined using OpenAPI Specification ([`IS4`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:115)).
*   **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC):** For authentication and authorization of Data Consumers and potentially for securing inter-service communication where appropriate ([`SC2`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:100), [`IS6`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:117)).
*   **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Used for identifying all entities (citizens, consumers, issuers, services).
*   **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) & Presentations (VPs):** For exchanging attestations and consent receipts, typically in `vc+jwt` or `vc+ldp` formats.
*   **JSON/JSON-LD:** Primary data interchange format for API payloads and VCs, promoting semantic interoperability ([`IS3`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:113)).
*   **DIDComm (Optional but Recommended):** For secure, private, peer-to-peer communication, especially between Wallets and other DID-enabled agents (e.g., for credential exchange, consent negotiation, PDS interaction). This enhances decentralization and privacy.

**5. DID and VC Management and Verification**

*   **DID Management:**
    *   **Creation:** Citizens create and manage their DIDs primarily through their Wallet application. Supported methods include `did:key` (for easy, local, self-sovereign DIDs), `did:web` (for DIDs anchored to a domain name), and potentially `did:ion` or similar ledger-based methods for globally resolvable, censorship-resistant DIDs ([`TR1`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:16), [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:134`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:134)). Private keys associated with DIDs are generated and stored securely within the Wallet's encrypted storage, under citizen control.
    *   **Resolution:** Any component needing to verify a DID or retrieve its associated DID Document (containing public keys, service endpoints, etc.) uses the DID Resolver/Registry. The resolver abstracts the specific resolution mechanism for different DID methods.
    *   **Management:** The Wallet provides functionalities for key rotation, backup, and recovery of DIDs, crucial for long-term usability. DID Documents are updated as needed (e.g., when keys are rotated or service endpoints change).

*   **VC Management and Verification:**
    *   **Issuance:**
        *   Trusted Issuers (e.g., government agencies, educational institutions, employers) use the VC Issuance Service (or their own compatible systems) to create VCs.
        *   The VC is cryptographically signed by the issuer's DID.
        *   VCs are securely transmitted to the Citizen's Wallet (e.g., via DIDComm, secure download link after authentication).
    *   **Storage:**
        *   Citizens store their VCs within their Wallet/PDS, encrypted with their keys. They have full control over which VCs they hold and share.
    *   **Presentation:**
        *   When a Data Consumer requires proof of certain attributes, the citizen (via their Wallet) selects the relevant VCs and creates a Verifiable Presentation (VP).
        *   The VP is signed by the citizen's DID (proving holder control) and may include only selected attributes from the VCs (selective disclosure) and a nonce or challenge from the verifier to prevent replay attacks.
    *   **Verification (performed by Secure Data Sharing Gateway or Data Consumer via VC Verification Service):**
        1.  **VP Integrity:** Verify the signature on the VP (using the citizen/holder's public key from their resolved DID).
        2.  **VC Integrity:** For each VC within the VP, verify its signature (using the issuer's public key from their resolved DID).
        3.  **Issuer Trust:** Determine if the issuer's DID is trusted for the type of VC presented (can be based on pre-configured trust lists, a trust framework, or other mechanisms).
        4.  **VC Validity:** Check `issuanceDate`, `expirationDate` (if present).
        5.  **Revocation Status:** Check if any VC in the VP has been revoked by querying the VC Revocation Registry using the method specified in the VC (e.g., `statusListCredential` property).
        6.  **Constraints & Purpose:** Verify that the VC content meets the verifier's requirements and is appropriate for the transaction.

**6. Modularity and Scalability**

*   **Modularity:**
    *   **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Each core component (Citizen Wallet, Consent Module, Gateway, VC Service, Audit Service, DID Resolver) is designed as a distinct service with well-defined, versioned APIs (e.g., following microservices principles). This allows for:
        *   Independent development, testing, and deployment cycles.
        *   Technology stack flexibility for individual services.
        *   Replacement or upgrade of a single component without impacting the entire system.
    *   **Standardized Interfaces:** Adherence to OpenAPI for REST APIs, W3C standards for DIDs/VCs, and potentially DIDComm ensures loose coupling and interoperability.
    *   **Decoupling:** Citizen-controlled components (Wallet/PDS) are clearly separated from shared infrastructure (DID Resolver, Audit Log) and service provider-facing components (Gateway, Consumer Apps).

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:**
        *   Stateless services like the Secure Data Sharing Gateway (API processing part), VC Verification Service, and the query/validation aspects of the Consent Management Module can be horizontally scaled by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.
        *   DID Resolvers can be scaled and distributed; caching of DID documents can reduce load on underlying DID networks.
    *   **Database Scalability:**
        *   **Consent Management Module:** PostgreSQL can be scaled using read replicas for query-heavy operations (consent verification) and potentially sharding for very large datasets, though careful schema design is key.
        *   **Audit Service:** If using DLT, scalability depends on the chosen DLT's transaction throughput and storage capacity. For database-backed immutable logs, solutions like time-series databases or append-only ledgers designed for high ingest rates can be used.
        *   **VC Revocation Registry:** Status lists are inherently scalable as they are typically static files. More dynamic revocation mechanisms would need their own scaling strategies.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:**
        *   Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka as per [`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:167`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:167)) will be used for non-critical path operations like sending notifications (e.g., consent revocation notices to consumers), batch audit log processing, and other background tasks. This decouples services and improves responsiveness and resilience.
    *   **Citizen Wallet/PDS:** Scalability is inherently distributed. As the number of citizens grows, each manages their own wallet and data, distributing the load. The central systems need to scale to handle the increased number of interactions (API calls, DID resolutions), not the citizen data storage itself.
    *   **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker and Kubernetes ([`DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:169`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:169)) will be used for packaging, deploying, and managing the backend services, enabling automated scaling, rolling updates, and efficient resource utilization.

**7. ROO Alignment (Robust, Optimized, Open/Otherwise-compliant)**

*   **Robust (Resilience & Security):**
    *   **Fault Isolation:** Modular design limits the blast radius of component failures.
    *   **Data Durability:** Resilient data stores for consent records and audit logs (e.g., replicated databases, DLTs). Citizen data backup/recovery managed by Wallet.
    *   **Security:** End-to-end encryption for sensitive data in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256 for PDS with citizen-controlled keys, database encryption). Secure key management (HSMs considered for critical system keys). RBAC/ABAC for administrative access. Regular security audits and penetration testing ([`SC4`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:104)). Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) ([`SC5`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:105)).
*   **Optimized (Performance & Efficiency):**
    *   **Scalable Design:** As detailed above, components are designed for horizontal scaling and efficient resource use.
    *   **Efficient Protocols:** Use of lightweight protocols like JSON, and optimized data retrieval paths. Caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., DID documents).
    *   **Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs):** Architecture allows for integration of PETs like ZKPs for selective disclosure (Wallet/VC Service) as they mature and become practical for specific use cases ([`TR5`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:33)).
*   **Open/Otherwise-compliant:**
    *   **Open Standards:** Strict adherence to W3C DID Core, VC Data Model, OpenAPI, JSON-LD, OAuth 2.0, OIDC ([`TR4`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:29), Section 4.2 of Spec). Support for multiple DID methods and VC formats.
    *   **Interoperability:** Ensures different wallets, issuer services, and consumer applications can interact with the ecosystem.
    *   **Compliance:** Designed to meet privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA ([`PR1`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:121)) through features like explicit consent, data minimization, purpose limitation, data portability, and right to erasure (via data deletion in PDS and revocation of consent). Privacy by Design and by Default principles are embedded ([`PR2`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:122)).

**8. Data Minimization Enforcement - Architectural Level**

Data minimization ([`OR6`](DEC-01_Specification_v1.md:65)) is enforced through several architectural mechanisms:

*   **Granular Consent:** The Consent Management Module stores and enforces consent at a granular attribute level. Citizens specify exactly which data points are shared.
*   **Selective Disclosure (VCs):** Wallets support creating VPs that only include the necessary claims from VCs, rather than revealing the entire credential.
*   **Gateway Enforcement:** The Secure Data Sharing Gateway, guided by the verified consent from the Consent Management Module, only requests and allows passage of the specifically authorized data attributes from the PDS/Wallet. Any additional data is filtered out.
*   **Purpose Limitation:** Consent records explicitly tie data sharing to a specific purpose. The Gateway ensures requests align with this consented purpose.
*   **Role of PETs:** Future integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs would allow citizens to prove something about their data without revealing the data itself, further enhancing minimization.

**9. Conclusion**

This architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for the DEC-01 citizen-centric data sharing platform. By prioritizing modularity, decentralization, open standards, and robust security, it aims to create a trustworthy ecosystem where citizens are empowered with genuine control over their personal data. The design facilitates secure and consensual data exchange, fostering innovation while respecting individual privacy. The clear separation of concerns among components allows for iterative development, adaptability to evolving standards, and scalability to meet future demands.

**10. Next Steps**

With the architecture for DEC-01 defined, the subsequent phases of the DGC-DEC project will build upon this foundation:

*   **DEC-02: Sign and Verify With My Domain:** This phase will focus on leveraging the established DID infrastructure to enable domain-based digital signing. It will explore how citizens and organizations can use their domain-associated DIDs to sign documents or attestations, and how these signatures can be verified, linking digital actions to trusted domain names. Architectural considerations will include services for signature creation, timestamping, and verification workflows integrated with the existing components.

*   **DEC-03: Domain Name Signature Provider:** Building on DEC-02, this phase will involve the practical implementation of a "Domain Name Signature Provider." This service will act as a trusted entity or facilitate the process for domain owners to issue and manage VCs or other attestations linked to their domain, further solidifying the concept of domain-based trust in the digital ecosystem. This will likely involve deeper integration with domain registrar systems or DNS-based verification mechanisms.
